# Documentation Alignment Report
**Date**: December 2, 2025
**Task**: Comprehensive review and alignment of all markdown documentation files

---

## Executive Summary

Completed a deep dive into all 32 markdown files in the repository to ensure alignment with the project's core objectives:
- ✅ Full production app for AI-powered legal letter generation
- ✅ Three-tier user system (subscriber/employee/admin)
- ✅ AI draft generation → admin review/edit/approval → subscriber dashboard workflow
- ✅ Employee discount coupons (20%) with commission tracking (5%)
- ✅ First letter free trial system

**Result**: Identified and fixed **3 critical inconsistencies** across documentation files.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **CRITICAL**: README.md Contained Wrong Content
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- README.md contained Supabase CLI documentation instead of project documentation
- File was completely misaligned with the actual project (Talk-To-My-Lawyer)

**Impact**:
- Developers/users would be completely confused about the project
- No quick-start information available
- Project appeared unprofessional

**Fix Applied**:
- Completely rewrote README.md with proper project documentation
- Added comprehensive overview of the three-tier system
- Included quick start guide, tech stack, business model, and all key features
- Added links to all other documentation files
- Documented production status and completed features

**Files Changed**:
- `README.md` (Complete rewrite - 383 lines)

---

### 2. ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**: Inconsistent AI Provider References
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md referenced "Gemini API" instead of current implementation
- Inconsistent AI provider documentation across multiple files
- Environment variable examples showed `GEMINI_API_KEY` instead of `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Impact**:
- Developers would try to set up wrong AI provider
- Documentation didn't match actual codebase implementation
- Confusion about which AI service to use

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md line 16: "Gemini API call" → "OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo via Vercel AI SDK"
- Updated DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md line 393-394: Environment variable from `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Added clarifying comment: "# AI - OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo via Vercel AI SDK"

**Files Changed**:
- `DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md` (3 edits)

**Note**: GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md was already correctly marked as DEPRECATED with proper warning notices.

---

### 3. ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Pricing Inconsistencies
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md showed old pricing: $10/$25/$60
- Other documentation correctly showed: $299/$299/$599
- Plan letter allocations were also inconsistent

**Impact**:
- Confusion about actual pricing model
- Potential issues with Stripe integration setup
- Misalignment between documentation and business model

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md plan pricing table:
  - `one_time`: $10 → $299 (1 letter)
  - `monthly_standard`: $25/mo → $299/mo (4 letters)
  - `monthly_premium`: $60/mo → $599/yr (8 letters, changed from monthly to yearly)

**Files Changed**:
- `DATABASE_FUNCTIONS.md` (Pricing table update)

---

### 4. ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**: Package Manager Inconsistencies
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- CLAUDE.md documented package manager as "npm"
- Actual project uses "pnpm" (evidenced by pnpm-lock.yaml)
- All command examples used "npm run dev" instead of "pnpm dev"

**Impact**:
- Minor confusion for developers setting up the project
- Wrong commands in documentation

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated CLAUDE.md line 40: "Package Manager: npm" → "Package Manager: pnpm"
- Updated all command examples:
  - `npm install` → `pnpm install`
  - `npm run dev` → `pnpm dev`
  - `npm run build` → `pnpm build`
  - All other npm commands updated to pnpm

**Files Changed**:
- `CLAUDE.md` (4 edits)

## Remaining Known Issues (Not Documentation)

### Code Implementation Gaps (Not Documentation Issues)
These are documented in existing alignment reports and are **code** issues, not documentation issues:

1. Missing `coupon_usage` table (documented in DATABASE_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md)
2. Missing database functions: `add_letter_allowances`, `validate_coupon`
3. Missing API endpoint: `/api/letters/[id]/start-review`
4. Rate limiting not implemented (documented in CODE_DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md)
5. Email delivery implementation incomplete

**Note**: These are code/implementation gaps, not documentation problems. The documentation correctly describes what *should* exist.

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ **Documentation is Now Aligned**
All markdown files now accurately represent the Talk-To-My-Lawyer platform with:
- Correct AI provider (OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo via Vercel AI SDK)
- Accurate pricing ($299/$299/$599)
- Proper package manager (pnpm)
- Comprehensive project overview in README.md

### 🔄 **Next Steps for Full Alignment**
To achieve complete code-documentation alignment, address the code implementation gaps:
1. Create `coupon_usage` table via database migration
2. Implement missing database functions
3. Create `/api/letters/[id]/start-review` endpoint
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Complete email delivery functionality

See `CODE_DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` and `DATABASE_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` for detailed implementation plans.
